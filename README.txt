This was the final project submission from my Operating Systems class in the Spring of my Freshman year (2012) at Carleton College.

The aim of the project was for students to create our own basic operating system. The entire operating system is written in Java. Some of the test files are COFF files compiled from code written in C. For more information on Nachos, see the included "Nachos5javaGuide.pdf" or the API: <http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp11/Nachos/doc/index.html>

We were provided with some code to begin with, but implemented the majority of the features including:
+ Threading
+ System Calls: Halt, Exec, Exit, Join, Create, Read, Write, Open, and Close
+ Basic networking capabilities

The modifications are in the userprog, threads, network, and machine packages. Files changed for the class have a modified date of 2012 as opposed to 2006 of the other files.
